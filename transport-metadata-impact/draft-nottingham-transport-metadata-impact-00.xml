<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Recently, there has been an increasing amount of discussion in the IETF about adorning protocol flows with metadata about the network’s state for consumption by applications, as well as that of the application in order to inform decisions in the network. For examples, see <xref target="I-D.nottingham-gin"/>, <xref target="I-D.sprecher-mobile-tg-exposure-req-arch"/> and <xref target="I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype"/>.</t>

<t>These discussions are being at least partially motivated by the increasing use of encryption, both in deployment (thanks to the Snowden revelations) and standards (thanks in some part to <xref target="RFC7258"/>, <xref target="IAB-confidentiality"/>, and <xref target="TAG-securing-web"/>); while it’s becoming widely accepted that networks don’t have legitimate need to access the content of flows in most cases, they still wish to meet certain use cases that require more information.</t>

<t>For example, networks may wish to communicate their state to applications, so that link limitations and transient problems can be accounted for in applications, by doing things like degrading (or improving) video streaming quality. </t>

<t>Applications also need to give enough information to networks to enable proper function; e.g., packets in UDP flows need to be associated to be able to cleanly transit NAT and firewalls. See <xref target="I-D.trammell-stackevo-newtea"/> and <xref target="I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases"/> for more discussion.</t>

<t>At the same time, it has been widely noted that “metadata” in various forms can be profoundly sensitive information, particularly in aggregate. </t>

<t>Indeed, much of the effort in combatting pervasive monitoring (as per <xref target="RFC7258"/>) has focused on minimizing metadata in existing, known protocols (such as TLS and HTTP).</t>

<t>Any new metadata facility, then – whether it be introduced to an existing protocol, or as part of a new one – should be held up to scrutiny.</t>

<t>This draft attempts to identify potential harms associated with new metadata facilities in Internet protocols, and suggest possible mitigations. Its goal is to have the discussion of these tradeoffs up-front, rather than after the development of such mechanisms.</t>

<t>It should be noted that the addition of metadata to protocols isn’t being posed as an inherent harm – i.e., there are some legitimate uses of metadata, particularly if it eases the adoption of encrypted protocols. However, the balance between the interests of stakeholders like end users, content providers and network operators needs to be carefully considered.</t>

<section anchor="potential-impact" title="Potential Impact">

<section anchor="security-and-privacy" title="Security and Privacy">

<t>In late 2014, it was found that Verizon was injecting HTTP headers into requests that identified their mobile customers using a unique identifier, allowing “third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors’ web browsing habits without their consent.”  <xref target="X-UIDH"/></t>

<t>In doing so, Verizon was taking advantage of a relatively unconstrained extension point in the HTTP protocol – header fields. While HTTP header fields do require registration <xref target="RFC3864"/>, the requirements are lax, and fields are often used without registration, because there is no technical enforcement of the requirements, due to HTTP’s policy of ignoring unrecognized header fields <xref target="RFC7230"/>.</t>

<t>HTTP header fields can be made a protected end-to-end facility by using HTTPS, avoiding the risk of such injection. A new transport metadata facility that explicitly allows any node on the path to add arbitrary metadata cannot.</t>

<t>Well-intentioned metadata can also put the user at substantial risk without careful consideration. For example, if a Web browser “labels” flows based upon what they contain (e.g., “video”, “image”, “interactive”), an observer on the network path – including pervasive ones – can more effectively perform traffic analysis to determine what the user is doing.</t>

<t>Standardizing an extensible transport metadata mechanism could also trigger various jurisdictions to define and require insertion of in-band metadata, an extension of current practices <xref target="AU-data-retention"/>. While the IETF would not be directly responsible for such an outcome, it is notable that in the past we’ve explicitly said we won’t serve conceptually similar use cases <xref target="RFC1984"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-neutrality" title="Network Neutrality">

<t>There is obvious potential for network neutrality impact from a mechanism that allows networks to communicate with endpoints about flows. </t>

<t>For example, if a network can instruct content servers to throttle back bandwidth available to users for video based upon a commercial arrangement (or lack thereof), the network can achieve their goals without directly throttling traffic, thereby offering the potential to circulate a regulatory regime that’s designed to effect Network Neutrality.</t>

<t>While the IETF has not take as firm a stance on Network Neutrality as it has for Pervasive Monitoring (for good reasons, since Network Neutrality problems are at their heart a sign of market failure, not a technical issue), new metadata facilities that enable existing regulatory regimes – thereby upsetting “the tussle” – must be carefully considered.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="possible-mitigations" title="Possible Mitigations">

<section anchor="constrained-vocabulary" title="Constrained Vocabulary">

<t>Much of the potential for harm above comes about because a transport-level metadata mechanism effectively becomes a side channel for arbitrary data, for use by any node on the path. The risks of questionable use could be mitigated by constraining the data that’s allowed in this side channel.</t>

<t>In other words, if the network doesn’t have a means of inserting a unique identifier for customers, they won’t be able to do so. If notification of constrained network conditions takes place using well-defined terms, regulatory regimes can be adjusted to achieve desired outcomes. And, information about application semantics can be carefully vetted for security considerations before being included in transport metadata.</t>

<t>Technically, the vocabulary could be constrained by merely requiring nodes to silently drop non-standard metadata. </t>

<t>Naturally, this would constrain the ability of networks and applications to add new terms to metadata, thereby requiring more careful thought to go into the metadata that is standardised “up front.” </t>

</section>
<section anchor="transparency" title="Transparency">

<t>Many proposals for transport metadata assert that it will be encrypted, to improve security. While well-intentioned, it also creates an opaque side channel with a third party (the first and second being the endpoints). </t>

<t>The effect of of such designs should be carefully considered before standardisation; it may be that the community is better served by keeping this metadata “in the clear”, albeit possibly with some form of authentication and integrity available (or required).</t>

<abstract><t>Rapidly-varying conditions in a cellular network can cause problems for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which in turn can degrade application performance.  This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles.  It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a mobile throughput guidance exposure mechanism that can be used to assist TCP in cellular networks, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced service delivery performance.  The proposed mechanism can be applied to any content or TCP/IP based application content delivery.  This document describes the applicability of the mechanism for Intelligent Video Acceleration over cellular networks.</t></abstract>
