1.  Introduction

   [RFC3864] established common IANA registries for header fields from a
   variety of protocols.  Experience has shown that having a combined
   registry has few benefits, and creates a number of issues, including:

   o  Difficulty in evolving the registration process (without
      coordination with other protocols),

   o  Registry user confusion, due to the large number of header fields
      registered,

   o  Using one expert to review all header field registrations is
      onerous to that individual,

   o  Lack of HTTP community involvement / oversight in reviews.

   While these issues could be mitigated by a RFC3864bis, it is more
   straightforward to separate the HTTP registrations out into a
   separate registry; since there is only slight syntactic similarity
   between header fields between protocols (and often, the mismatches

   create confusion), and little semantic overlap, this seems like the
   best path forward.

   Therefore, this document establishes a new HTTP Header Field
   Registry, defines its procedures, and guides the transition of
   existing values to it.  Doing so effectively removes HTTP header
   fields from the scope of [RFC3864] and the registries it defines, and
   updates [RFC7231] Section 8.3 with a new process for managing them.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The HTTP Header Field Registry

   The "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Header Field Registry"
   defines the namespace for HTTP header fields (as per [RFC7230],
   Section 3.2).  It is maintained at http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   http-headers.

2.1.  Requesting Registration

   Any party can request registration of a HTTP header field.  See
   [RFC7231] Section 8.3.1 for considerations to take into account when
   creating a new HTTP header field.

   Registration requests can be sent to the "http-
   registrations@ietf.org" mailing list.  The Expert(s) MAY establish
   alternate means of requesting registrations, which SHOULD be linked
   to from the registry page.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  *Header field name*: The requested field name.  It MUST conform to
      the field-name syntax defined in [RFC7230], Section 3.2, and
      SHOULD be restricted to just letters, digits, hyphen ('-') and
      underscore ('_') characters, with the first character being a
      letter.

   o  *Status*: "permanent" or "provisional"

   o  *Author/Change controller*: For a standards-track RFC, state
      "IETF".  For other open standards, give the name of the publishing
      body (e.g., "W3C").  For other specifications, give the name and/
      or organisation name and e-mail address of the primary
      specification author.

   o  *Specification document(s)*: Reference to the document that
      specifies the header field, preferably including a URI that can be
      used to retrieve a copy of the document.  An indication of the
      relevant section(s) MAY also be included, but is not required.

   The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry, in consultation with the community.

   Header fields that are defined in an IETF standards-track document,
   have a comparable amount of review (typically, as an Open Standard in
   the sense of [RFC2026], section 7), or are generally recognised to be
   in widespread use (in the judgment of the Expert(s)) MAY be
   registered with the status "permanent".  Such registrations MUST have
   a defining specification that is publicly available.

   Other header fields MUST be registered with the status "provisional".

2.2.  Registration Request Processing

   Header fields are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert
   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate).  Header fields with the
   status 'permanent' are Specification Required (using terminology from
   [RFC5226]).

   The goal of the registry is to reflect common use of HTTP on the
   Internet.  Therefore, the Expert(s) SHOULD be strongly biased towards
   approving registrations, unless they are abusive, frivolous, not
   likely to be used on the Internet, or actively harmful to the
   Internet and/or the Web (not merely aesthetically displeasing, or
   architecturally dubious).

   The Expert(s) MUST clearly identify any issues which cause a
   registration to be refused.  Advice about the syntax or semantics of
   a proposed header can be given, but if it does not block
   registration, this SHOULD be explicitly stated.

   When a request is approved, the Expert(s) will inform IANA, and the
   registration will be processed.  The IESG is the final arbiter of any
   objection.

2.3.  Updating Registrations

   After registration, the change controller MAY request that the status
   of a registration be changed to "obsoleted", request that the change
   controller be updated, and/or request that the specification
   document(s) be updated.

Internet-Draft            HTTP Header Registry            September 2017


   Likewise, the IESG MAY request changes to the registry at any time.
   The Expert(s) MAY act on the IESG's behalf to update incorrect or
   out-of-date permanent entries.

   All such requests are subject to the same conditions and processes
   described in Section 2.2.

   If the Expert(s) make reasonable attempts to contact a change
   controller but cannot contact them, they MAY update a registration.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Registry Creation

   IANA will create a new registry as outlined in Section 2.

   After creating the registry, all entries in the Permanent and
   Provisional Message Header Registries with the protocol 'http' are to
   be moved to it, with the following changes applied:

   1.  The 'Applicable Protocol' field is to be omitted.

   2.  Entries with a status of 'standard', 'experimental', or
       'informational' are to have a status of 'permanent'.

   3.  Entries with a status of 'deprecated' are to have a status of
       'obsoleted'.

   4.  Provisional entries without a status are to have a status of
       'provisional'.

   5.  Permanent entries without a status (after confirmation that the
       registration document did not define one) will have a status of
       'provisional'.  The Expert(s) MAY choose to update their status
       if there is evidence that another is more appropriate.

   The Permanent and Provisional Message Header registries will be
   annotated to indicate that HTTP header field registrations have
   moved, with an appropriate link.

3.2.  Registry Operation

   IANA will direct any incoming requests regarding the registry to this
   document and, if defined, the processes established by the Expert(s);
   typically, this will mean referring them to the registry Web page.

   The Expert(s) will provide registry data to IANA in an agreed form
   (e.g. a specific XML format).  IANA will publish:

   o  The raw registry data

   o  The registry data, transformed into HTML

   o  The registry data in any alternative formats provided by the
      Expert(s)

   Each published document will be at a URL agreed to by IANA and the
   Expert(s), and IANA will set HTTP response headers on them as
   (reasonably) requested by the Expert(s).

   Additionally, the HTML generated by IANA will:

   o  Take directions from the Expert(s) as to the content of the HTML
      page's introductory text

   o  Include a stable HTML fragment identifier for each registered
      header field

   All registry data documents MUST include Simplified BSD License text
   as described in Section 4.e of the Trust Legal Provisions
   (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

4.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those already inherent in the use of HTTP header fields.
