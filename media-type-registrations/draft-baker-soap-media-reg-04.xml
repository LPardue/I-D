<section title="Introduction"> 

   <t>SOAP version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for
      exchange of structured information between peers in a decentralized,
      distributed environment. It defines an extensible messaging framework
      that contains a message construct based on XML technologies that can
      be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols.</t>

   <t>This specification defines the media type "application/soap+xml" 
      which can be used to identify SOAP 1.2 message envelopes that have 
      been serialized with XML 1.0. Such serializations are useful as the 
      basis "wire formats" for SOAP 1.2 Protocol Binding Specifications 
      <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624"/>, or in other situations where an XML serialization of a 
      SOAP envelope is required.</t>

  <t hangText="MIME media type name:">
	application</t>
	
     <t hangText="MIME subtype name:">
	soap+xml</t>
	
     <t hangText="Required parameters:">
	none</t>
	
     <t hangText="Optional parameters:">
	<list style="hanging">
	<t hangText='"charset":'>
	This parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter 
	of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023 <xref target="RFC3023"/>. 
	<xref target="RFC3023"/>.</t>
	
	<t hangText='"action":'>
	This optional parameter can be used to specify the URI that
		identifies the intent of the message. In SOAP 1.2, it serves a
		similar purpose as the SOAPAction HTTP header field did in SOAP 1.1.
		Namely, its value identifies the intent of the message.</t>

	<t>The value of the action parameter is an absolute URI-reference as
		defined by RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/>. SOAP places no restrictions on the
		specificity of the URI or that it is resolvable.</t>

	<t>Although the purpose of the action parameter is to indicate the
		intent of the SOAP message there is no mechanism for automatically
		computing the value based on the SOAP envelope. In other words, the
		value has to be determined out of band.</t>

	<t>It is recommended that the same value be used to identify sets of
		message types that are logically connected in some manner, for
		example part of the same "service". It is strongly RECOMMENDED that
		the URI be globally unique and stable over time.</t>

	<t>The presence and content of the action parameter MAY be used by
		servers such as firewalls to appropriately filter SOAP messages and
		it may be used by servers to facilitate dispatching of SOAP messages
		to internal message handlers etc. It SHOULD NOT be used as an
		insecure form of access authorization.</t>

	<t>Use of the action parameter is OPTIONAL. SOAP Receivers MAY use it as
		a hint to optimize processing, but SHOULD NOT require its presence in
		order to operate.</t>

     <t hangText="Encoding considerations:">
	Identical to those of "application/xml" as described in RFC 3023 
	<xref target="RFC3023"/>, section 3.2, as applied to the SOAP envelope infoset.</t>
	
     <t hangText="Security considerations:">
	     Because SOAP can carry application defined data whose semantics is
          independent from that of any MIME wrapper (or context within which
          the MIME wrapper is used), one should not expect to be able to
          understand the semantics of the SOAP message based on the semantics
          of the MIME wrapper alone. Therefore, whenever using the
          "application/soap+xml" media type, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
          the security implications of the context within which the SOAP
          message is used is fully understood. The security implications are
          likely to involve both the specific SOAP binding to an underlying
          protocol as well as the application-defined semantics of the data
          carried in the SOAP message (though one must be careful when doing
          this, as discussed in SOAP 1.2 Part 1 <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624"/>, section Binding
          to Application-Specific Protocols.</t>

     <t>Also, see SOAP 1.2 Part 1 <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624"/>, the entire section Security
          Considerations.</t>

     <t>In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it
          shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023 <xref target="RFC3023"/>, section 10.</t>
     
     <t hangText="Interoperability considerations:">
	There are no known interoperability issues.</t>
	
     <t hangText="Published specification:">
	SOAP 1.2 Part 1 <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624"/> and SOAP 1.2 Part 2 <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624"/>.</t>
