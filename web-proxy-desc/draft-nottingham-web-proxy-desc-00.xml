<t>This specification defines a simple means of configuring Web proxies, and places additional
requirements upon them in order to promote improved interoperability, security, and error handling.</t>



    </abstract>


  </front>

  <middle>


<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Web proxies are configured in a variety of ways today, but existing approaches suffer from
security, usability and interoperability issues.</t>

<t>This specification defines:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A simple format for describing a Web proxy (“WPD”; see <xref target="wpd"/>) to facilitate configuration, and
so that it can be represented to users in a consistent way, and</t>
  <t>A way to discover the proxy description using a well-known URL <xref target="discover"/>, so that direct
configuration of a proxy is as simple as entering a hostname, and</t>
  <t>A set of additional requirements for proxies described in this fashion, as well as requirements
for User Agents connecting to them, designed to improve security, usability and interoperability.</t>
</list></t>

<t>It can be used in a variety of ways, but is designed to meet the following goals:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Users should always be aware of a configured proxy and be able to confidently identify it, and</t>
  <t>Configuring a proxy should be a deliberate act, but simple to do for non-technical users, and</t>
  <t>Proxies should always respect the wishes of the end user and Web site, and</t>
  <t>Proxies should never reduce or compromise the security of connections, and improve it where
possible, and</t>
  <t>The proxy should be able to reliably communicate with the end user regarding its policies and
problems that are encountered.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Furthermore, it is designed to be useful in the following cases:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>An end user wants to use a proxy network that provides improved performance, by re-compressing
responses to http:// resources.</t>
  <t>An end user wants to use a proxy network that provides improved privacy, by routing requests
through any number of intermediaries.</t>
  <t>An end user is required to use a proxy to access Internet resources by their network (e.g., a
school, workplace or prison).</t>
</list></t>

<t>Importantly, this specification does not address the automatic discovery of proxy configuration for
a given network.</t>

<t>It is expected that the mechanisms described could be implemented by a single program (e.g., a Web
browser), or through an Operating System facility.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="wpd" title="The Web Proxy Description (WPD) Format">

<t>WPD is a JSON <xref target="RFC7159"/> format that describes a Web proxy to its clients. Its root is an object
containing WPD-specific object members. For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
    "name": "ExampleCorp Web Proxy",
    "desc": "ExampleCorp's Proxy Gateway for Web access. Note that
             all traffic through this proxy is logged, and may be
             filtered for content."
    "moreInfo": "https://inside.example.com/proxy/",
    "proxies": [
        {
            "host": "proxy.example.com",
            "port": 8080,
            "validNetworks": ["192.0.2.0/24"]
            },
        {
            "host": "proxy1.example.com",
            "port": 8080,
            "validNetworks": ["192.0.2.0/24"]
        }
    ],
    "bypassDomains": ["example.com", "192.0.2.0/24"],
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>When configuring a proxy through WPD, the User agent SHOULD present the relevant information
contained within (i.e., the ‘name’, ‘desc’ and ‘moreInfo’ members, the latter as a link) to the end
user. User agents SHOULD also make this information available to the end user whenever the WPD is
in use.</t>

<t>The remainder of this section defines the content of these members. Unrecognized members SHOULD
be ignored.</t>

<section anchor="name" title="name">

<t>A string containing a short, memorable name for the proxy; typically 64 characters or less. This
member MUST be present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="desc" title="desc">

<t>A string containing a textual description of the proxy’s function(s); typically 256 characters or
less. This member MUST be present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="moreinfo" title="moreInfo">

<t>A string containing a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> that leads to more information about the proxy, its
operation, who operates it, etc. The URI MUST have a scheme of “https” <xref target="RFC7230"/>, and MUST be
able to respond with an HTML <xref target="W3C.CR-html5-20140731"/> representation. This member MUST be present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="proxies" title="proxies">

<t>An array containing one or more proxy objects; each proxy object represents a proxy endpoint that
can be used when this proxy is configured.</t>

<t>Proxy objects’ members are defined by the following subsections; unrecognized members SHOULD be
ignored.</t>

<t>The ordering of proxy objects within the proxies array is not significant; clients MAY choose any
proxy they wish (keeping in mind the requirements of validNetworks), and MAY use more than one at a
time.</t>

<t>When connecting to a WPD proxy, clients MUST use TLS and MUST validate the hostname as per
<xref target="RFC2818"/> Section 3.1. If the proxy presents an invalid certificate, that proxy MUST be
considered “failed” and not used (until a valid certificate is presented).</t>

<t>WPD Proxies MUST support HTTP/2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/> connections from clients. Clients
that cannot establish a HTTP/2 connection to a WPD proxy MUST consider that proxy “failed.”</t>

<t>WPD Proxies MUST support forwarding requests with the “http” scheme <xref target="RFC7230"/>, and SHOULD support
the CONNECT method, as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/> Section 8.3.</t>

<t>When user agents encounter 5xx responses to a CONNECT request from a WPD proxy, they MUST present
the response to the end user, but MUST NOT present or process it as a response to the eventual
request to be made through the tunnel (i.e., it has an identified payload, as per <xref target="RFC7231"/>
Section 3.1.4.1).</t>

<t>If a proxy becomes unresponsive, clients SHOULD consider it failed and attempt to use another proxy
(if available) or inform the end user (if not available). Clients SHOULD regularly attempt to
re-establish contact with failed proxies (e.g., every minute).</t>

<t>NOTE: the array of proxy objects is functionally similar to, but not as expressive as, the
commonly-used “proxy.pac” format. While it would be expedient for WPD to just reference a
proxy.pac, feedback so far is that proxy.pac has a number of deficiencies, and interoperability
over it is poor. Therefore, this document specifies the proxy object instead, in order to gather
feedback on an alternative approach.</t>

<section anchor="host" title="host">

<t>A string containing the host (as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>, section 3.2.2) of the proxy. This member MUST be
present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="port" title="port">

<t>A number representing the port that the proxy is listening on. This member MUST be present, and
MUST be an integer.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="validnetworks" title="validNetworks">

<t>An array containing strings; each string contains a classless prefix <xref target="RFC4632"/> which the proxy
can be used within. Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use the proxy if their IP address is within one
of the stated ranges.</t>

<t>This member is optional.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="bypassdomains" title="bypassDomains">

<t>An array containing strings; each string is either a host (as per <xref target="RFC3986"/> Section 3.2.2) or a classless prefix <xref target="RFC4632"/>. Clients SHOULD NOT use the WPD’s proxies to access these domains.</t>

<t>Note that when a “bare” IP address or classless prefix is used in bypassDomains, clients are not
required to perform a reverse lookup on hostnames; these forms are only intended for accessing URLs
that use the IP-literal or IPv4address forms.</t>

<t>This member is optional.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="discover" title="Discovering WPD Files">

<t>To facilitate easy configuration of Web proxies, this specification defines a well-known URI
<xref target="RFC5785"/>. Doing so allows a proxy’s description to be found with a simple hostname; e.g.,
“proxy.example.net” or even just “example.net”.</t>

<section anchor="well-known" title="The web-proxy-desc well-known URI">

<t>The “web-proxy-desc” well-known URI allows discovery of a Web Proxy Description (<xref target="wpd"/>).</t>

<t>This well-known URI is only valid when used with the “https” URI Scheme <xref target="RFC7230"/>; it MUST NOT be
used with “http” URIs. In other words, WPD discovery is always protected by TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

<t>The description found at this location is considered valid for its freshness lifetime, as defined
in <xref target="RFC7234"/> Section 4.2. Once stale, clients SHOULD refresh it and apply any changes.</t>

<t>If the WPD is not retrievable (e.g., a 404 response status), invalid (as per JSON <xref target="RFC7159"/> or
the requirements in <xref target="wpd"/>), or its certificate is not valid for the host (as per <xref target="RFC2818"/>
Section 3.1), the client MUST NOT use the WPD, and if a user agent, SHOULD inform the end user.</t>

<t>The registration template is:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>URI suffix: web-proxy-desc</t>
  <t>Change controller: IETF</t>
  <t>Specification document(s): [this document]</t>
  <t>Related information: only to be used with ‘https’ scheme</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This specification registers a new well-known URI, as per <xref target="RFC5785"/>. See <xref target="well-known"/> for the
template.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>If a user can be convinced to configure a WPD hostname as their proxy, that host can observe all
unencrypted traffic by the client. As such, WPD configuration interfaces ought only allow
configuration of proxies once their identity is validate (as required), and the user ought to be
given access to all relevant information about the WPD proxy (i.e., ‘name’, ‘desc’ and ‘moreInfo’,
the latter as a link). Furthermore, WPD proxies ought only be configured as the result of an
intentional act, not as a side effect of normal Web browsing.</t>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.
