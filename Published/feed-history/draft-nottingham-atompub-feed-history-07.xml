      <abstract>
<t>This specification defines three types of syndicated feeds that enable
publication of entries across one or more feed documents.</t>
      </abstract>    
	  
  </front>    

  <middle>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Syndicated Web feeds (using such formats as Atom <xref target="RFC4287"/> or RSS 2.0) are often split up into multiple documents to save bandwidth, allow "sliding window" access, or for other purposes.</t>

<t>This specification formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or more feed documents; "paged" feeds and "archived" feeds. Additionally, it defines "complete" feeds to cover the case when a single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries.</t>

<t>These types are complementary; each has different properties and trade-offs:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Complete feeds contain the entire set of entries in one document, and can be useful when it isn't desirable to "remember" previously-seen entries.</t>
<t>Paged feeds split the logical feed's entries among multiple temporary documents. This can be useful when entries in the feed are not long-lived or stable, and the client needs to access an arbitrary portion of them, usually in close succession.</t>
<t>Archived feeds split them among multiple permanent documents, and can be useful when entries are long-lived and it is important for clients to see every one.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Although they refer to Atom normatively, the mechanisms described herein can be used with similar syndication formats, such as the various flavors of RSS.</t>


<section title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/>, as
scoped to those conformance targets.</t>
	
<t>This specification uses XML Namespaces <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114"/> to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;</t>

<t>"fh": "http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0"</t>
</section>

<section title="Terminology">

<t>In this specification, "feed document" refers to an Atom Feed Document,
RSS document, or similar syndication instance document. It may contain any 
number of entries (in RSS, items), and may or may not be a complete representation of the logical feed.</t>

<t>A "logical feed" is the set of entries associated with a particular feed (as contrasted with a feed document, which may contain a subset of them).</t>

<t>"Head section" refers to the children of a feed document's document-wide metadata container; e.g., the child elements of the atom:feed element in an Atom Feed Document.</t>

<t>This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204"/>. However, this
specification uses a shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when
naming Element Information Items. Therefore, when this specification uses the
term "element," it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset
terms.</t>

<t>This specification also uses Atom link relations to identify different types 
of links; see the Atom specification <xref target="RFC4287"/> for information about their syntax, and the IANA link relation registry for more information about specific values.</t>

</section>

</section>


<section title="Complete Feeds">

<t>A complete feed is a feed document that contains all of the entries of a logical feed; any entry not actually in the feed document SHOULD NOT be considered to be part of that feed.</t>

<t>For example; a feed that represents a ranking that varies over time, such as "Top Twenty Records" or "Most Popular Items" should not have newer entries displayed alongside older ones. By marking them as complete feeds, old entries are discarded when the feed is refreshed.</t>

<t>The fh:complete element, when present in a feed's head section, indicates that the feed document it occurs in is a complete representation of the logical feed's entries.</t>

<section title="Paged Feeds">

<t>A paged feed is a set of linked feed documents that together contain the entries of a logical feed, without any guarantees about the stability of the documents' contents.</t>

<t>Paged feeds are lossy; that is, it is not possible to guarantee that clients will be able to reconstruct the contents of the logical feed at a particular time. Some entries may be added or changed as the pages of the feed are accessed, without the client becoming aware of them.</t>

<t>Paged feeds can be useful when the number of entries is very large, infinite, or indeterminate. Clients can "page" through the feed, only accessing a subset of the feed's entries as necessary.</t>

<t>For example, a search engine might make query results available as a paged feed, so that queries with very large result sets do not overwhelm the server, the network, or the client.</t>

<t>The feed documents in a paged feed are tied together with the following link relations:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>"first" - A URI that refers to the furthest preceding document in a
series of documents.</t>

<t>"last" - A URI that refers to the furthest following document in a
series of documents.</t>

<t>"previous" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding
document in a series of documents.</t>

<t>"next" - A URI that refers to the immediately following document in a
series of documents.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Paged feed documents MUST have at least one of these link relations present, and SHOULD contain as many as practical and applicable.</t>

<t>Note that URI references in link relation values may be relative, and when they are used they must be absolutised, as described in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>

<section title="Archived Feeds">

<t>An archived feed is a set of feed documents that can be combined to accurately reconstruct the entries of a logical feed.</t>

<t>Unlike paged feeds, archived feeds enable clients to do this without losing any entries. This is achieved by publishing a single subscription document and (potentially) many archive documents.</t>

<t>A subscription document is a feed document that always contains the most recently added or changed entries available in the logical feed (often, the feed document that should be subscribed to).</t>

<t>Archive documents are feed documents that contain less recent entries in the feed. The set of entries contained in an archive document published at a particular URI SHOULD NOT change over time. Likewise, the URI for a particular archive document SHOULD NOT change over time.</t>

<t>These stability requirements allow clients to safely assume that if they have retrieved an archive document from a particular URI once, it will not meaningfully change in the future. As a result, if an archive document's contents are changed, clients may not become aware of it.</t>

<t>Therefore, if a publisher requires a change to be visible to all users (e.g., correcting factual errors), they should consider publishing the revised entry in the subscription feed, in addition to (or instead of) the appropriate archive feed. Conversely, unimportant changes (e.g., spelling corrections) might be only effected in archive feeds.</t>

<t>Typically, a subscription feed will link to a set of archive documents (also linked together) which contain progressively less recent entries.</t>

<t>Clients can then "subscribe" to the feed, polling the subscription document for recent changes. If a client has missed some entries, the archives can be used to synchronise its state by fetching the archive documents it has not yet seen.</t>

<t>The following link relations are used to tie subscription and archived feeds together:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>"prev-archive" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding
archive document.</t>
<t>"next-archive" - A URI that refers to the immediately following
archive document.</t>
<t>"current" - A URI that, when dereferenced, returns a feed document
containing the most recent entries in the feed.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Subscription documents and archive documents MUST have a "prev-archive" link relation, unless there are no archives available.</t>

<t>Archive documents SHOULD have "next-archive" and "current" link relations.</t>

<t>Note that URI references in link relation values may be relative, and when they are used they must be absolutised, as described in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>

<t>Archive document SHOULD also contain an fh:archive element in their head sections, to indicate that they are archives.</t>

<figure>
  <preamble>For example,</preamble>
  <artwork>
  &lt;fh:archive/>
  </artwork>
</figure>

<t>Publishers are not required to make all archive documents available; they 
may refuse to serve (e.g., with HTTP status code 403 or 410), or be unable to serve (e.g., with HTTP status code 404) an archive document.</t>

<t>Clients SHOULD warn users when they are not able to reconstruct the complete, logical feed (e.g., by alerting the user that an archive document is unavailable, or displaying pseudo-entries that inform the user that some entries may be missing). </t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>Feeds using the mechanisms described here could be crafted in such a way as to cause a client to initiate excessive (or even an unending sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service (either to the client, the target server, and/or intervening networks). Clients can mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after a certain number of requests, or by limiting requests either according to a hard limit, or with heuristics.</t>

<t>Clients should be mindful of resource limits when storing feed documents. To reiterate, they are not required to always store or reconstruct the feed when conforming to this specification; they only need inform the user when the reconstructed feed is not complete.</t>

<t>One algorithm for reconstructing an archived feed into a complete, logical feed (S), give the subscription document (D) follows.</t>

<t>
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Create an empty list L.</t>
    <t>Consider the URI of the last archive document successfully stored to local store S as A.</t>
    <t>Consider the set of entries in document D as E.</t>
    <t>If the document D has a "prev-archive" link relation value P in its head section, and P is not A,
      <list style="numbers">
         <t>Append P to L.</t>
         <t>Dereference P and use the resulting feed document as D.</t>
      </list></t>
    <t>Repeat the previous step until no new P is found.</t>
    <t>Add all of document D's entries to the local store S, replacing any entries with the same identity.</t>
    <t>Pop the last "prev-archive" link relation from L, dereference its value
    and use the resulting feed document as D.</t>
    <t>Repeat the previous two steps until L is empty.</t>
    <t>Add the entries E to the local store S, replacing any entries with the same identity.</t>
  </list>
</t>

<t>In these instructions, the concept of an entry's identity is format-specific; e.g., in Atom, it is conveyed by the atom:id element; in RSS 2, it is indicated by the guid element.</t>
