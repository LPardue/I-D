<t>This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of
cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those
relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked
Cache Invalidation (LCI).</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>In normal operation, a HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> cache will invalidate a stored response if an
unsafe request (e.g., POST, PUT or DELETE) is made to its URI. HTTP also provides for such a
state-changing request to invalidate related resources (using the Location and Content-Location
headers in the response), but this is of limited utility, because those headers have defined
semantics, and can only occur once each.</t>

<t>Because of this, it is not practical to make a response that depends on the state of another
resource cacheable. For example, an update to a blog entry might change several different
resources, such as the user’s summary page, the blog’s “front” page, the blog’s Atom feed, and of
course the blog entry itself. If any of these resources is made cacheable, it will not reflect
those changes, causing confusion if the user tries to verify that their changes have been correctly
applied.</t>

<t>This memo introduces new link relation types <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/> that allow more
fine-grained relationships between resources to be defined, so that caches can invalidate all
related representations when the state of one changes. It also introduces a cache-control response
extension, so that responses using the relations can be cached by implementations that understand
these relations.</t>

<section anchor="example" title="Example">

<t>Taking the blog use case described above, imagine that we have the following related resources:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>http://example.com/blog/2012/05/04/hi [the blog entry]</t>
  <t>http://example.com/blog/2012/05/04/hi/comments [full comments for the entry]</t>
  <t>http://example.com/blog/ {the blog “home”}</t>
  <t>http://example.com/users/bob/ [the user page, listing his entries]</t>
</list></t>

<t>When someone comments on Bob’s blog entry, they might send a request like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
POST /cgi-bin/blog.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 7890

[...]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>When the comment is successful, it’s typical to redirect the client back to the original blog page,
with a response like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://example.com/blog/2012/05/04/hi
Content-Length: 0

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Which would invalidate the blog entry URI, as per HTTP’s normal operation.</t>

<t>To invalidate the full comments page for the entry, the relationship can be described in that
page’s response headers:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 5555
Link: </blog/2012/05/04/hi>; rel="inv-by"
Cache-Control: no-cache, inv-maxage=600

[...]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This declares that whenever the entry page (the target of the link header) changes, this response
(the full comments page) changes as well; it’s invalidated by the link target.</t>

<t>Note that the full comments page also carries a Cache-Control header that instructs “normal” caches
not to reuse this response, but allows those caches that are aware of LCI to consider it fresh for
ten minutes.</t>

<t>To invalidate the blog home page and user page, it’s impractical to list all of the resources that
might change if a new entry is posted; not only are there many of them, but their URLs might not be
known when the pages are cached. To address this, the POST response itself (i.e., when the comment
is made) can nominate resources to invalidate, using the ‘invalidates’ relation, making that
response:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://example.com/blog/2012/05/04/hi
Link: <http://example.com/blog/>; rel="invalidates",
      <http://example.com/users/bob/>; rel="invalidates"
Content-Length: 0

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Depending on how important it is to see updates on the home page and user page, those responses can
either allow caching regardless of support for LCI, like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Cache-Control: max-age=300
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>… or they can only allow caching by LCI-aware caches, like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Cache-Control: no-cache, inv-maxage=300
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Together, these techniques can be used to invalidate a variety of related responses.</t>

<t>It is important to note that the invalidations are only effective in the caches that the client’s
request stream travels through. This means other caches will continue to serve the “old” content
until the invalidation event is propagated to them (see below) or the cached responses become stale.</t>

<t>When multiple caches are close together, the HyperText Caching Protocol (HTCP) <xref target="RFC2756"/> can be used to propagate invalidation events between them.</t>

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC7230"/>, and explicitly
includes the following rules from it: delta-seconds.</t>

<section anchor="invalidates" title="The ‘invalidates’ Link Relation Type">

<t>The ‘invalidates’ link relation type allows a response that signifies a state change on the server
to indicate one or more associated URIs whose states have also changed.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Relation name: invalidates</t>
  <t>Description: Indicates that when the link context changes, the link target also has changed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inv-by" title="The ‘inv-by’ Link Relation Type">

<t>The ‘inv-by’ link relation type allows a response to nominate one or more other resources that
affect the state of the resource it’s associated with. That is, when one of the nominated resources
changes, it also changes the state of this response’s resource.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Relation name: inv-by</t>
  <t>Description: Indicates that when the link target changes, the link’s context has also changed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inv-maxage" title="The ‘inv-maxage’ Response Cache-Control Extension">

<t>When present, the ‘inv-maxage’ cache-control extension indicates the number of seconds that caches
who implement Linked Cache invalidation can consider responses fresh for, provided they are not
invalidated.</t>

<section anchor="inv-maxage-syntax" title="inv-maxage Syntax">

<t>The inv-maxage cache-control extension is parameterised with a numeric argument:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
"inv-maxage" "=" ( delta-seconds | ( <"> delta-seconds <"> ) )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that the argument MAY occur in either token or quoted-string form.</t>

<t>If the argument is missing or otherwise does not conform to the BNF rule, it is invalid and MUST be
ignored by caches.</t>

<t>If the directive appears more than once in a response, each instance is invalid and MUST be ignored
by caches.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inv-maxage-semantics" title="inv-maxage Semantics">

<t>HTTP caches MAY, if they fully implement this specification, disregard the HTTP response
cache-control directives ‘no-cache’, ‘max-age’ and ‘s-maxage’ when a valid ‘inv-maxage’
cache-control directive is present in a response, using its value as a replacement for max-age.</t>

<t>HTTP caches using inv-maxage to calculate freshness MUST invalidate all stored responses whose
request-URIs (after normalisation) are the target of a ‘invalidates’ link relation contained in a
successful response to a state-changing request, provided that they are allowed.</t>

<t>HTTP caches using inv-maxage to calculate freshness MUST invalidate all stored responses containing
a ‘inv-by’ link relation whose target is the current request-URI (after normalisation) upon receipt
of a successful response to a state-changing request.</t>

<t>Likewise, HTTP caches using inv-maxage to calculate freshness MUST invalidate all stored responses
containing a ‘inv-by’ link relation whose target is the content of either the Location or
Content-Location response headers (after normalisation) upon receipt of a successful response to a
state-changing request.</t>

<t>Here, a response is considered to “contain” a link relation if it is carried in the Link HTTP
header <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/>. I.e., it is not necessary to look at the response body.</t>

<t>“Invalidate” means that the cache will either remove all stored responses related to the effective
request URI, or will mark these as “invalid” and in need of a mandatory validation before they can
be returned in response to a subsequent request.</t>

<t>A “successful” response is one with a 2xx or redirecting 3xx (e.g., 301, 302, 303, 307) status code.</t>

<t>A “state-changing” request is one with an unsafe method (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), or one
that is not known to be safe.</t>

<t>In this context, “normalisation” means, in the case of a relative request-URI, that it is
absolutised using the value of the Host request header and the appropriate protocol scheme.</t>

<t>Finally, an invalidation based upon “invalidates” is “allowed” if the host part of the request-URI
(if absolute) or Host request header (if the request-URI is relative) matches the host part of the
target URI. This prevents some types of denial-of-service attacks.</t>

<t>Implementations SHOULD effect invalidations when they become aware of changes through other means;
e.g., HTCP <xref target="RFC2756"/> CLR messages, upon invalidations caused by other links (i.e., chained
“cascades” of linked invalidations), or when a changed response is seen (such as when HTTP
validation is unsuccessful).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Linked Cache Invalidation does not guarantee that invalidations will be effected; e.g., they can be
lost due to network issues or cache downtime. Furthermore, it does not guarantee that all caches
that understand LCI will be made aware of invalidations that happen, because of how they originate.</t>

<t>Therefore, care should be taken that LCI invalidations are not relied upon (e.g., to purge
sensitive content).</t>

<t>Furthermore, while some care is taken to avoid denial-of-service attacks through invalidation,
cache efficiency may still be impaired under certain circumstances (e.g., arranging for one request
to invalidate a large number of responses), leading to a reduction in service quality.</t>

<t>This document registers two entries in the Link Relation Type Registry; see <xref target="invalidates"/> and
<xref target="inv-by"/>.</t>

<t>It also registers a HTTP Cache Directive, “inv-maxage”; see <xref target="inv-maxage"/>.</t>
