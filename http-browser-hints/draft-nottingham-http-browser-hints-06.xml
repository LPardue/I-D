      <abstract>

         <t>Over time, HTTP clients -- especially Web browsers -- have adapted
         how they use the protocol based upon common server configurations and
         behaviours. While this is necessary in the common case, it can be
         detrimental for performance and interoperability.</t>

         <t>This document establishes a mechanism whereby origin servers can
         make hints available to clients about their preferences and
         capabilities, without imposing undue overhead on their interactions or
         requiring support for them.</t>

         <t>This is intended to allow clients to safely optimise connections
         to servers.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">

        <t>HTTP <xref target="HTTP-p1"/> clients -- especially browsers --
        typically use hardcoded values or heuristics to determine how they use
        TCP, based on common-case server behaviours and limitations.</t>

        <t>For example, they often send voluminous request headers (e.g., in
        User-Agent and Allow) because they fear that changing those headers'
        values will break some sites that depend upon specific values.</t>

        <t>These conservative behaviours are good for interoperability, but
        potentially bad for performance in certain circumstances.</t>

        <t>This document specifies a mechanism whereby a HTTP server can
        advertise hints for browsers and other clients, so that
        communication with them can be optimised.</t>

        <t>It does so by defining a single header; "OH" (Origin Hints). A
        selection of hints are also defined in this document, and a registry
        is defined to allow future such hints.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

        <t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
        of <xref target="RFC5234"/>, and explicitly includes the following
        rules from it: ALPHA, DIGIT. Additionally, it uses the list rule
        extension defined in <xref target="HTTP-p1"/>, Appendix B.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Origin Hints" anchor="origin">

        <t>Origin Hints are applicable to all future requests to the origin
        <xref target="RFC6454"/> associated with the response, until they are
        overridden. They are carried in the "OH" header field's value.</t>
        
        <figure><artwork>
OH = #hint
</artwork></figure>

        <t>A hint is considered overridden when an OH header field is seen
        from the same origin that does not contain the hint, or contains a
        different value for the hint.</t>

        <t>In practice, this means that servers can send the OH header only on
        selected messages, if it wishes, but when it is sent, it needs to
        include all of the hints that are considered valid. Likewise, clients
        can cache origin hint values indefinitely, updating them when new OH
        header fields are seen from an origin.</t>

        <t>For example, an origin may send an OH header on every response, in
        which case the latest one seen would be the value used, or it could
        send one sporadically (e.g., upon connection), in which case the
        origin hints in effect would be the last one seen by the client.</t>

        <t>Therefore, origins that wish to have their hints available to
        clients as soon as possible will send them on every response; those
        that wish to limit the sizes of responses might use some other
        strategy, knowing that clients will eventually cache their hints.</t>

      <t>For example:</t>

      <figure><artwork>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
OH: a,b=6,c
Content-Length: 1234
Cache-Control: max-age=60

...
</artwork></figure>

      <t>Here, the origin hints "a", "b", and "c" are indicated; the "b" hint
      has a value of "6". If a subsequent message from the same origin
      to the same client were:</t>

      <figure><artwork>
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Content-Type: text/html
OH: a,b=2
Content-Length: 1234
Cache-Control: max-age=60

...
</artwork></figure>

      <t>The client would now consider "a" to still be true, whereas the
        value of "b" would be 2, and "c" would be false.</t>

      <t>Origin hints SHOULD NOT be generated by proxy servers.</t>

    </section>


    <section title="Hint Syntax" anchor="syntax">

      <t>All origin hints share a common syntax, consisting of
      a string of alphanumeric characters. This form is designed to be compact
      without sacrificing readability.</t>

      <t>Every hint has a case-sensitive hint name.</t>

      <figure><artwork>
hint = hint_name [ "=" hint_value ]
hint_name = ALPHA *( DIGIT / "_" / "-" )
hint_value = 1*DIGIT
</artwork></figure>

      <t>Hints are allowed to have a numeric value. However, wherever
      possible, they are encouraged to be defined as flags (i.e., as a
      hint name only), so that the hints don't consume too much
      space in responses.</t>

      <t>Hints can be defined as one of two types:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Boolean - indicated by the presence of the hint name. If
          the hint name is absent in the last message containing the
          relevant hint header field, it is considered false.</t>

          <t>Numeric - value indicated by the digits after "=", up to the
          first non-digit character. If the hint does not have an argument,
          its value is assumed to be 0.</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>Note that HTTP/1.1 allows headers with comma-separated values to be
      conveyed using multiple instances of the same header; as a result, hints
      are collected from all instances of the OH header on the message in
      question before being considered complete.</t>

    <section title="Pre-defined Hints" anchor="hints">

      <section title="Small Request Headers">

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Hint Name: s</t>
            <t>Description: When true, this hint indicates that clients
            can omit the Accept and Accept-Charset request headers when
            communicating with the origin, and that they can use a
						shortened version of the User-Agent header.</t>

						<t>Description: When true, this hint indicates that all cookies
            <xref target="RFC6265"/> can be omitted in requests to the

      <section title="Security Considerations">
         <t>By their nature, hints are both optional and advisory; clients
           ought to exercise judgement when applying them, as an attacker
           might use a naive implementation to trick the client into 
           generating abnormal traffic.
           </t>
           
          <t>Hints are also only as secure as the channel they are
            transmitted upon; if HTTP is used in the clear, then hints might
            be observed (which typically is not a great risk), and modified
            (which could be, for a naive client implementation).</t>

       </section>

       <section title="The HTTP Origin Hints Registry" anchor="registry">

         <t>This document establishes the HTTP Origin Hints Registry.</t>

         <t>New hints are registered using Expert Review (see
           <xref target="RFC5226"/>), by sending e-mail to <eref
           target="mailto:iana@iana.org"/> (or using other mechanisms, as
           established by IANA).</t>
           
         <t>New hints are expected to be implemented in at least one client in
         common use. The Expert MAY use their judgement in determining what
         "common" is, and when something is considered to be implemented.</t>

         <t>New hints MUST be optional; they cannot place requirements upon
         implementations.</t>

         <t>Specifically, new hints MUST NOT make communication non-conformant
         with HTTP itself; i.e., this is not a mechanism for changing the HTTP
         protocol in incompatible ways. For example, if a hint indicates that
         browsers can compress request headers using GZIP, intermediaries that
         are interposed are likely to fail.</t>
         
         <t>New hints SHOULD convey information that's relevant to an
           entire origin; it is inappropriate to use origin hints to advertise
           resource-specific attributes.
         </t>

         <t>See <xref target="syntax"/> for constraints on the syntax of
         hint names and hint values.</t>

         <t>Registration requests MUST use the following template:</t>

         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Hint Name: [name of hint]</t>
              <t>Description: [description of hint]</t>
              <t>Value Type: ["boolean" or "numeric"] </t>
  	          <t>Contact: [e-mail address(es)]</t>
  	          <t>Specification: [optional; reference or URI to more info]</t>
  	          <t>Notes: [optional]</t>
            </list>
          </t>

         <t>The initial contents of the registry are defined in <xref
         target="hints"/>.</t>

      <section title="Open Issue: Hint Syntax">

        <t>This revision defines the syntax of hints as a comma-delimited 
          list. This is convenient (especially for delimiting hints with
          values), but if many hints need to be conveyed, it'll be
          inefficient.</t>
          
        <t>An alternate syntax could remove the commas, but we'd likely be
          constrained in the number of hints we'd be able to define.</t>
          
        <t>Yet another approach would be to define a bitfield, and an ASCII
          representation of that field. However, this would be cumbersome.</t>
