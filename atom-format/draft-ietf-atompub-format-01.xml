        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>Atom is an XML-based document format intended to allow lists of
            related information, known as "feeds", to be synchronised between
            publishers and consumers. Feeds are composed of a number of items,
            known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
            metadata. For example, each entry has a title.</t>
            
            <t>The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of
            Web content such as Weblogs and news headlines, to Web sites as
            well as directly to user agents. However, nothing precludes
            it from being used for other purposes and kinds of content.</t>
            
            <t>Details of comunication protocols between software agents using
            Atom can be found in the Atom Protocol specification <xref
            target="Atom-protocol"/>.

                <t>The Atom format is a work-in-progress, and this draft is both 
                incomplete and likely to change rapidly. As a result, THE FORMAT
                DESCRIBED BY THIS DRAFT SHOULD NOT BE DEPLOYED, either in production
                systems or in any non-experimental fashion on the Internet.</t>

            <section title="Notational Conventions">
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
                and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
                described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>			
            
                <t>This specification uses XML Namespaces <xref
                target="W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114"/> to uniquely identify XML
                elements and attribute names. It uses the following namespace
                prefixes for the indicated namespace URIs;</t>
                
                <t><list style="hanging">
                  <t hangText='"atom": '>http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-&docrev;</t>
                </list></t>
                
                <t>Note that the choice of any namespace prefix is arbitrary
                and not semantically significant.</t>
                
                <t>Atom is specified using terms from the XML Infoset <xref
                target="W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20011024"/>. However, this
                specification uses a shorthand for two common terms; the phrase
                "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information Items
                and Attribute Information Items.</t>
                
                <t>Therefore, when this specification uses the term
                "element," it is refering to an Element Information Item in
                Infoset terms. Likewise, when it uses the term "attribute," it
                is refering to an Attribute Information Item.</t>

        <section title="Atom Documents">
            
            <t>This specification describes two kinds of Atom Documents; Atom
            Feed Documents and Atom Entry Documents.</t>
            
            <t>An Atom Feed Document is a representation of an
            Atom feed, including metadata about the feed, and some or all of the
            entries associated with it. Its document element is atom:feed.</t>
            
            <t>An Atom Entry Document represents exactly one Atom Entry, outside
            of the context of an Atom Feed. Its document element is atom:entry.</t>
                        
            <t>Both kinds of Atom documents are specified in terms of the XML
            Information Set, serialised as XML 1.0 <xref
            target="W3C.REC-xml-20040204"/> and identified with the
            "application/atom+xml" media type. Atom Documents MUST
            be well-formed XML.</t>
            
            <t>[[ Validity? ]]</t>
            
            <t>Atom constrains the appearance and content of elements and
            attributes; unless otherwise stated, Atom Documents MAY contain
            other Information Items as appropriate. In particular, Comment
            Information Items and Processing Instruction Information Items
            SHOULD be ignored in the normal processing of an Atom
            Document.</t>
                                                
            <t>Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:base attribute.
            XML Base <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627"/> processing MUST
            be applied to any relative URI reference present in an Atom
            document. This includes such elements and attributes as specified
            by Atom itself, as well as those specified by extensions to
            Atom.</t>
 
            <t>Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:lang attribute,
            whose content indicates the default natural language of the
            element's content. Requirements regarding the content and
            interpretation of xml:lang are specified in <xref
            target="W3C.REC-xml-20040204">XML 1.0</xref> Section 2.12. For
            convenience, the most important are summarised here:</t>
                        
            <t><list>
            <t>The content of this attribute must be a
            language tag <xref target="RFC3066"/> or an empty string (e.g.,
            xml:lang=""), which indicates that there is no language
            information available.</t>
            
            <t>If an element does not have an xml:lang element, the first
            xml:lang attribute in its ancestors indicates the natural language
            of its content.</t>
            </list></t>

            <t>Many of Atom's elements share a few common structures. This

                <t>The "atom:copyright" element is a Content construct
                that conveys a human-readable copyright statement for
                the entry. atom:entry elements MAY contain an
                atom:copyright element, but MUST NOT contain more than
                one.</t>
    
                <t>The atom:copyright element SHOULD NOT be used to
                convey machine-readable licensing information.</t>
    
                <t>If an atom:entry element does not contain an atom:copyright
                element, then the atom:copyright element of the containing
                atom:feed element's atom:head element, if present, should be
                considered to apply to the entry.</t>

                <t>The "atom:origin" element's content conveys
                the original source of the entry; e.g., the feed where the
                entry was first published.</t>
                     
                <t>If the source is an Atom Feed Document, then the content of
                atom:origin MUST be the same, character-for-character,
                as that of the href attribute of the atom:link element that
                has a rel attribute value of "alternate" in that document's
                atom:head section (i.e., the XPath expression
                "/atom:feed/atom:head/atom:link[@rel='alternate']/@href").</t>

                <t>The content of this element MUST be a URI. atom:entry
                elements MAY contain an atom:origin element, but MUST NOT
                contain more than one.</t>
