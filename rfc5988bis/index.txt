1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a way to indicate the relationships
   between resources on the Web ("links") and the type of those
   relationships ("link relation types").

   HTML [W3C.CR-html5-20140731] and Atom [RFC4287] both have well-
   defined concepts of linking; this specification generalises this into
   a framework that encompasses linking in these formats and
   (potentially) elsewhere.

   Furthermore, this specification formalises an HTTP header field for
   conveying such links, having been originally defined in
   Section 19.6.2.4 of [RFC2068], but removed from [RFC2616].

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC7230], including the #rule, and explicitly includes the following
   rules from it: quoted-string, token, SP (space), LOALPHA, DIGIT.

   Additionally, the following rules are included from [RFC3986]: URI
   and URI-Reference; from [RFC6838]: type-name and subtype-name; from
   [W3C.CR-html5-20140731]: MediaDesc; from [RFC5646]: Language-Tag; and
   from [I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis], ext-value and parmname.

3.  Links

   In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two
   resources, and is comprised of:

   o  A link context,

   o  a link relation type (Section 4),




Nottingham               Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                  October 2015


   o  a link target, and

   o  optionally, target attributes.

   A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{link context} has a
   {link relation type} resource at {link target}, which has {target
   attributes}".

   Link contexts and link targets are both IRIs [RFC3987].  However, in
   the common case, the link context will also be a URI [RFC3986],
   because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support dereferencing
   IRIs.  Likewise, the link target will be sometimes be converted to a
   URI (see [RFC3987], Section 3.1) in places that do not support IRIs
   (such as the Link header field defined in Section 5).

   This specification does not place restrictions on the cardinality of
   links; there can be multiple links to and from a particular target,
   and multiple links of the same or different types between a given
   context and target . Likewise, the relative ordering of links in any
   particular serialisation, or between serialisations (e.g., the Link
   header and in-content links) is not specified or significant in this
   specification; applications that wish to consider ordering
   significant can do so.

   Target attributes are a set of key/value pairs that describe the link
   or its target; for example, a media type hint.  This specification
   does not attempt to coordinate their names or use, but does provide
   common target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.

   Finally, this specification does not define a general syntax for
   expressing links, nor does it mandate a specific context for any
   given link; it is expected that serialisations of links will specify
   both aspects.  One such serialisation is communication of links
   through HTTP headers, specified in Section 5.

4.  Link Relation Types

   In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics
   of a link.  For example, a link with the relation type "copyright"
   indicates that the resource identified by the link target is a
   statement of the copyright terms applying to the current link
   context.

   Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target
   resource has particular attributes, or exhibits particular
   behaviours; for example, a "service" link implies that the identified
   resource is part of a defined protocol (in this case, a service
   description).

   Relation types are not to be confused with media types [RFC6838];
   they do not identify the format of the representation that results
   when the link is dereferenced.  Rather, they only describe how the
   current context is related to another resource.

   Relation types SHOULD NOT infer any additional semantics based upon
   the presence or absence of another link relation type, or its own
   cardinality of occurrence.  An exception to this is the combination
   of the "alternate" and "stylesheet" registered relation types, which
   has special meaning in HTML for historical reasons.

   There are two kinds of relation types: registered and extension.

4.1.  Registered Relation Types

   Well-defined relation types can be registered as tokens for
   convenience and/or to promote reuse by other applications.  This
   specification establishes an IANA registry of such relation types;
   see Section 6.2.

   Registered relation type names MUST conform to the reg-rel-type rule,
   and MUST be compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive
   fashion.  They SHOULD be appropriate to the specificity of the
   relation type; i.e., if the semantics are highly specific to a
   particular application, the name should reflect that, so that more
   general names are available for less specific use.

   Registered relation types MUST NOT constrain the media type of the
   link context, and MUST NOT constrain the available representation
   media types of the link target.  However, they can specify the
   behaviours and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable
   HTTP methods, request and response media types that must be
   supported).

   Applications that wish to refer to a registered relation type with a
   URI [RFC3986] MAY do so by prepending
   "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/" to its name.  Note that
   the resulting strings are not considered equivalent to the registered
   relation types by many processors, and SHOULD NOT be serialised
   unless the application using link relations specifically allows them.

4.2.  Extension Relation Types

   Applications that don't wish to register a relation type can use an
   extension relation type, which is a URI [RFC3986] that uniquely
   identifies the relation type.  Although the URI can point to a
   resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the relation




Nottingham               Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                  October 2015


   type, clients SHOULD NOT automatically access that resource to avoid
   overburdening its server.

   When extension relation types are compared, they MUST be compared as
   strings (after converting to URIs if serialised in a different
   format, such as a Curie [W3C.CR-curie-20090116]) in a case-
   insensitive fashion, character-by-character.  Because of this, all-
   lowercase URIs SHOULD be used for extension relations.

   Note that while extension relation types are required to be URIs, a
   serialisation of links can specify that they are expressed in another
   form, as long as they can be converted to URIs.

5.  The Link Header Field

   The Link entity-header field provides a means for serialising one or
   more links in HTTP headers.  It is semantically equivalent to the
   <LINK> element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element
   in Atom [RFC4287].

5.1.  Link Target

   Each link-value conveys one target IRI as a URI-Reference (after
   conversion to one, if necessary; see [RFC3987], Section 3.1) inside
   angle brackets ("<>").  If the URI-Reference is relative, parsers
   MUST resolve it as per [RFC3986], Section 5.  Note that any base IRI
   from the message's content is not applied.

5.2.  Link Context

   By default, the context of a link conveyed in the Link header field
   is the IRI of the requested resource.

   When present, the anchor parameter overrides this with another URI,
   such as a fragment of this resource, or a third resource (i.e., when
   the anchor value is an absolute URI).  If the anchor parameter's
   value is a relative URI, parsers MUST resolve it as per [RFC3986],




Nottingham               Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                  October 2015


   Section 5.  Note that any base URI from the body's content is not
   applied.

   Consuming implementations can choose to ignore links with an anchor
   parameter.  For example, the application in use may not allow the
   link context to be assigned to a different resource.  In such cases,
   the entire link is to be ignored; consuming implementations MUST NOT
   process the link without applying the anchor.

   Note that depending on HTTP status code and response headers, the
   link context might be "anonymous" (i.e., no link context is
   available).  For instance, this is the case on a 404 response to a
   GET request.

5.3.  Relation Type

   The relation type of a link is conveyed in the "rel" parameter's
   value.  The "rel" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a given
   link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by parsers.

   The "rev" parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the
   semantics of the relationship are in the reverse direction.  That is,
   a link from A to B with REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a
   link from B to A with REV="X". "rev" is deprecated by this
   specification because it often confuses authors and readers; in most
   cases, using a separate relation type is preferable.

   Note that extension relation types are REQUIRED to be absolute URIs
   in Link headers, and MUST be quoted if they contain a semicolon (";")
   or comma (",") (as these characters are used as delimiters in the
   header itself).

5.4.  Target Attributes

   The "hreflang", "media", "title", "title*", "type", and any link-
   extension link-params are considered to be target attributes for the
   link.

   The "hreflang" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the
   language of the result of dereferencing the link should be.  Note
   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the
   Content-Language header of a HTTP response obtained by actually
   following the link.  Multiple "hreflang" parameters on a single link-
   value indicate that multiple languages are available from the
   indicated resource.

   The "media" parameter, when present, is used to indicate intended
   destination medium or media for style information (see



Nottingham               Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 8]

   [W3C.CR-html5-20140731], Section 6.13).  Note that this may be
   updated by [W3C.CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090915]).  Its value MUST be
   quoted if it contains a semicolon (";") or comma (","), and there
   MUST NOT be more than one "media" parameter in a link-value.

   The "title" parameter, when present, is used to label the destination
   of a link such that it can be used as a human-readable identifier
   (e.g., a menu entry) in the language indicated by the Content-
   Language header (if present).  The "title" parameter MUST NOT appear
   more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first
   MUST be ignored by parsers.

   The "title*" parameter can be used to encode this label in a
   different character set, and/or contain language information as per
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis].  The "title*" parameter MUST NOT
   appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the
   first MUST be ignored by parsers.  If the parameter does not contain
   language information, its language is indicated by the Content-
   Language header (when present).

   If both the "title" and "title*" parameters appear in a link-value,
   processors SHOULD use the "title*" parameter's value.

   The "type" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the
   media type of the result of dereferencing the link should be.  Note
   that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the
   Content-Type header of a HTTP response obtained by actually following
   the link.  There MUST NOT be more than one type parameter in a link-
   value.

5.5.  Examples

   For example:

   Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
         title="previous chapter"

   indicates that "chapter2" is previous to this resource in a logical
   navigation path.

   Similarly,

   Link: </>; rel="http://example.net/foo"

   indicates that the root resource ("/") is related to this resource
   with the extension relation type "http://example.net/foo".

Internet-Draft                 Web Linking                  October 2015


   The example below shows an instance of the Link header encoding
   multiple links, and also the use of RFC 5987 encoding to encode both
   non-ASCII characters and language information.

   Link: </TheBook/chapter2>;
         rel="previous"; title*=UTF-8'de'letztes%20Kapitel,
         </TheBook/chapter4>;
         rel="next"; title*=UTF-8'de'n%c3%a4chstes%20Kapitel

   Here, both links have titles encoded in UTF-8, use the German
   language ("de"), and the second link contains the Unicode code point
   U+00E4 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS").

   Note that link-values can convey multiple links between the same link
   target and link context; for example:

   Link: <http://example.org/>;
         rel="start http://example.net/relation/other"

   Here, the link to "http://example.org/" has the registered relation
   type "start" and the extension relation type
   "http://example.net/relation/other".

6.  IANA Considerations

   In addition to the actions below, IANA should terminate the Link
   Relation Application Data Registry, as it has not been used, and
   future use is not anticipated.

6.1.  Link HTTP Header Registration

   This specification updates the Message Header registry entry for
   "Link" in HTTP [RFC3864] to refer to this document.

   Header field: Link
   Applicable protocol: http
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller:
       IETF  (iesg@ietf.org)
       Internet Engineering Task Force
   Specification document(s):
       [RFC&rfc.number;]

6.2.  Link Relation Type Registry

   This specification establishes the Link Relation Type registry, and
   updates Atom [RFC4287] to refer to it in place of the "Registry of
   Link Relations".

   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file) must include
   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust
   Legal Provisions (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

6.2.1.  Registering New Link Relation Types

   Relation types are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert
   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a Specification
   Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).

   The requirements for registered relation types are described in
   Section 4.1.

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template
   below, typically published in an RFC or Open Standard (in the sense
   described by [RFC2026], Section 7).  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert may
   approve registration once they are satisfied that a specification
   will be published.

   Note that relation types can be registered by third parties, if the
   Designated Expert determines that an unregistered relation type is
   widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   The registration template is:

   o  Relation Name:

   o  Description:

   o  Reference:

   o  Notes: [optional]

   Registration requests should be sent to the link-relations@ietf.org
   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line (e.g., "NEW RELATION
   - example" to register an "example" relation type).

   Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an
   explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the
   request successful.

7.  Security Considerations

   The content of the Link header field is not secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
   it.  Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTP ([RFC2818] and
   [RFC2817]) is currently the only end-to-end way to provide such
   protection.

   Applications that take advantage of typed links should consider the
   attack vectors opened by automatically following, trusting, or
   otherwise using links gathered from HTTP headers.  In particular,
   Link headers that use the "anchor" parameter to associate a link's
   context with another resource should be treated with due caution.

   The Link entity-header field makes extensive use of IRIs and URIs.
   See [RFC3987] for security considerations relating to IRIs.  See
   [RFC3986] for security considerations relating to URIs.  See
   [RFC7230] for security considerations relating to HTTP headers.

8.  Internationalisation Considerations

   Link targets may need to be converted to URIs in order to express
   them in serialisations that do not support IRIs.  This includes the
   Link HTTP header.

   Similarly, the anchor parameter of the Link header does not support
   IRIs, and therefore IRIs must be converted to URIs before inclusion
   there.

   Relation types are defined as URIs, not IRIs, to aid in their
   comparison.  It is not expected that they will be displayed to end
   users.

   Note that registered Relation Names are required to be lower-case
   ASCII letters.

Appendix A.  Using the Link Header with the HTML Format

   HTML motivated the original syntax of the Link header, and many of
   the design decisions in this document are driven by a desire to stay
   compatible with these uses.

   In HTML, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here by
   using the "href" attribute for the target URI, and "rel" to convey
   the relation type, as in the Link header.  The context of the link is
   the URI associated with the entire HTML document.

   All of the link relation types defined by HTML have been included in
   the Link Relation Type registry, so they can be used without
   modification.  However, there are several potential ways to serialise
   extension relation types into HTML, including

   o  As absolute URIs,

   o  using the document-wide "profile" attribute's URI as a prefix for
      relation types, or

   o  using the RDFa [W3C.REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014] convention of
      mapping token prefixes to URIs (in a manner similar to XML name
      spaces).

   Individual applications of linking will therefore need to define how
   their extension links should be serialised into HTML.

   Surveys of existing HTML content have shown that unregistered link
   relation types that are not URIs are (perhaps inevitably) common.
   Consuming HTML implementations should not consider such unregistered
   short links to be errors, but rather relation types with a local
   scope (i.e., their meaning is specific and perhaps private to that
   document).

   HTML also defines several attributes on links that are not explicitly
   defined by the Link header.  These attributes can be serialised as
   link-extensions to maintain fidelity.

   Finally, the HTML specification gives a special meaning when the
   "alternate" and "stylesheet" relation types coincide in the same
   link.  Such links should be serialised in the Link header using a
   single list of relation-types (e.g., rel="alternate stylesheet") to
   preserve this relationship.

Appendix B.  Using the Link Header with the Atom Format

   Atom conveys links in the atom:link element, with the "href"
   attribute indicating the link target and the "rel" attribute
   containing the relation type.  The context of the link is either a
   feed locator or an entry ID, depending on where it appears;
   generally, feed-level links are obvious candidates for transmission
   as a Link header.

   When serialising an atom:link into a Link header, it is necessary to
   convert link targets (if used) to URIs.

   Atom defines extension relation types in terms of IRIs.  This
   specification re-defines them as URIs, to simplify and reduce errors
   in their comparison.

   Atom allows registered link relation types to be serialised as
   absolute URIs.  Such relation types SHOULD be converted to the
   appropriate registered form (e.g.,
   "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/self" to "self") so that
   they are not mistaken for extension relation types.

   Furthermore, Atom link relation types are always compared in a case-
   sensitive fashion; therefore, registered link relation types SHOULD
   be converted to their registered form (usually, lowercase) when
   serialised in an Atom document.

   Note also that while the Link header allows multiple relations to be
   serialised in a single link, atom:link does not.  In this case, a
   single link-value may map to several atom:link elements.

   As with HTML, atom:link defines some attributes that are not
   explicitly mirrored in the Link header syntax, but they can also be
   used as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.

Appendix C.  Acknowledgements

   This specification lifts the idea and definition for the Link header
   from RFC 2068; credit for it belongs entirely to the authors of and
   contributors to that document.  The link relation type registrations
   themselves are sourced from several documents; see the applicable
   references.

   The author would like to thank the many people who commented upon,
   encouraged and gave feedback to this specification, especially
   including Frank Ellermann, Roy Fielding, Eran Hammer-Lahav, and
   Julian Reschke.

Appendix D.  Changes from RFC5988

   This specification has the following differences from its
   predecessor, RFC5988:

   o  The initial relation type registrations were removed, since
      they've already been registered by 5988.

   o  The introduction has been shortened.

   o  The Link Relation Application Data Registry has been removed.

   o  Incorporated errata.

   o  Updated references.

   o  Link cardinality was clarified.

   o  Terminology was changed from "target IRI" and "context IRI" to
      "link target" and "link context" respectively.

   o  A convention for assigning a URI to registered relation types was
      defined.
